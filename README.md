Comet Software, a medium-sized software house has developed a number of products for warehousing, sales, purchasing etc. The company continues to enhance these products and develop new ones. Most customers on choosing to purchase software from Comet require modifications to be made to the standard software to suit their business.  
Comet employees divide their week (37.5 hours) between a number of projects as follows:  
1 day (7.5 hours): Work on Comet products. This work cannot be billed to customers. 
4 days (30 hours): Work on modifications to the standard products for various customers. (billable) 
•	Employees may work less (or more) than 30 hours/week on billable projects  o Any more than 30 hours/week on billable projects is overtime 
•	Employees may work more than 7.5 hours per day on billable projects 
•	Employees may work on no more than 3 billable projects per day. (An employee may work on less.) 
Every Friday employees enter the hours worked on each billable project during that week. Projects are identified by a code (2 characters). The minimum unit of work is 30 minutes. 
The application works as follows: 
For each (of the four) days, the program prompts the employee and s/he enters the project code(s) and the number of hours worked on each project.  
Once all the data for a single day has been entered the total billable hours worked that day is displayed. 
The employee can indicate that entry is completed for the current day by entering the project code 
‘ZZ’. 
Once all the data for the week has been entered the data is displayed as shown below: 
•	Employees who worked overtime are paid a bonus of €20 per hour. Overtime information is displayed if applicable 
 
Notes:  
•	All numeric values should be displayed to 2 decimal places 
•	Prompts should be consistent, clear and as helpful as possible to the user 
•	All output should be well formatted and consistent (spelling, upper/lower case etc.) 
•	You may assume that an employee will not enter hours for a particular project more than once each day 
•	If a user enters an invalid project code the program should reprompt until a valid code is entered 
•	To limit repetitive error checking code, you may assume that all other user data is correct (e.g., don’t test for type errors etc.) 
•	You will write the program without the use of a break or continue statement. 
You are required to design, code, and test a program that will read in each employee’s code along with the hours worked on billable project(s) for each of four days. You should then display the output as detailed above.
